                Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.<br>
                Software engineering is a computing discipline. When the first digital computers appeared in the early 1940s,<br>
                the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this <br>
                design was not flexible and came up with the "stored program architecture" or von Neumann architecture. Thus <br>
                the division between "hardware" and "software" began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity <br>
                of computing. Programming languages started to appear in the early 1950s and this was also another major step <br>
                in abstraction. Major languages such as Fortran, ALGOL, PL/I, and COBOL were released in the late 1950 and <br>
                1960s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively. David Parnas introduced the key<br>
                concept of modularity and information hiding in 1972 to help programmers deal with the ever-increasing <br>
                complexity of software systems. The origins of the term "software engineering" have been attributed to various <br>
                sources. The term "software engineering" appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 <br>
                issue of COMPUTERS and AUTOMATION and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of <br>
                the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) “letter to the ACM membership” by the ACM President Anthony A. Oettinger, it is<br>
                also associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer, the first <br>
                conference on software engineering. Independently, Margaret Hamilton named the discipline "software engineering"<br>
                during the Apollo missions to give what they were doing legitimacy. At the time there was perceived to be a <br>
                "software crisis". The 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) celebrates 50 years <br>
                of "Software Engineering" with the Plenary Sessions' keynotes of Frederick Brooks and Margaret Hamilton. In 1984,<br>
                the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center<br>
                headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Watts <br>
                Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering<br>
                process. The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become the Capability Maturity Model Integration for <br>
                Development(CMMI-DEV), which has defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development<br>
                team. Modern, generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by the ISO/IEC JTC<br>
                1/SC 7 subcommittee and published as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).
